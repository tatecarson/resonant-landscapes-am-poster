# Resonant Landscapes: Merging Nature and Technology

## Introduction
- Welcome! I'm [Your Name] from Dakota State University. Today I'm presenting Resonant Landscapes, a web-based application that merges nature and technology in a unique way.

## Project Overview
- Our project overlays ambisonic soundscapes from South Dakota state parks onto our university campus using GPS technology.
- We've embraced frugal innovation principles, utilizing existing smartphone sensors and open-source software to create an accessible, low-cost solution.

## User Experience
- The app works like this:
  - Users open it on their smartphones and see a map of our campus with various listening spots.
  - As they approach within 15 meters of a spot, they start hearing the park's soundscape.
  - The volume increases as they get closer to the center.
  - At the epicenter, users can enable body-oriented tracking, allowing them to change their listening perspective by physically turning their bodies.

## Technical Details
- We used a Core Audio OctomMic, a 2nd-order ambisonic microphone for recording.
- Technically, we built the app using React, Tailwind CSS, and the Resonance Audio SDK. It leverages smartphone GPS, gyroscope, and accelerometer sensors.

## Significance
- The significance of this project lies in creating a "hybrid place" that merges natural and urban soundscapes. It promotes ecological awareness and encourages attentive listening.
- Our work contributes to the fields of soundscape studies and locative media art, exploring how technology can deepen our connection to nature.

## Future Work
- Looking ahead, we plan to:
  - Refine the user experience through iterative design
  - Expand our soundscape database to include more diverse ecosystems
  - Implement longer, uninterrupted audio playback

## Conclusion
- We believe Resonant Landscapes opens up new possibilities for environmental education, urban planning, and experiential learning.
- Thank you for your attention. I'd be happy to answer any questions or even demo the app if you're interested!
